Stronghold-Finder Speedrun Assist!! 

This is a python program to assist minecraft speedrunning. Essentially, run it in the background, and in your speedrun, throw one eye of ender (don't move), face where it went, open the debug menu and press F9, then repeat with another triangulated point, and it the program will show where your stronghold is. It works because it uses triangulation math, reading the coords and facing from both debug-screen points.

Does not use seed but triangulation of ender-eye points, therefore making it fair use in speedruns.
